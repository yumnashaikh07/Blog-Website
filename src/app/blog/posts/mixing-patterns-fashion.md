# The Art of Mixing Patterns in Fashion

**Estimated Reading Time: 2 min**

Mixing patterns is an art that requires a good eye for balance and proportion. If done correctly, combining different patterns can elevate your outfit and create a bold fashion statement.

## How to Mix Patterns:
- **Stick to a Color Scheme**: When mixing patterns, choose patterns that share at least one color to create cohesion.
- **Use Varying Scales**: Pair a large, bold pattern with a smaller, more subtle one to avoid visual clutter.
- **Keep the Base Simple**: Choose simple, solid-colored garments as a base to let the patterns take center stage.

With the right balance, mixing patterns can make your outfit stand out in a fashionable way.
